## SQR: High Performance Secure QR System to Filter Against Malicious QR Codes Using Deep Learning Techniques

- Developed a high-performance system for detecting malicious and benign QR codes.
- The models used in the system are Vision Transformer (ViT), VGG16 and EfficientNet.   
- Paper is currently under review in Expert Systems with Applications Journal.
- Preprint available [here](../SQR_Expert_Systems.pdf).

## Interestingness from COVID-19 Data: Ontology and Transformer-Based Methods

- Identify interesting patterns using ontology-based mining techniques and process them with transformer models for identifying the interesting rules from the mined corpora.
- Paper is accepted for publication at ICON 2022, proceedings in ACL Anthology.
- Preprint available [here](../ACL_2022.pdf).

## Ontology-Based Semantic Data Interestingness Using BERT Models

- An effective data preprocessing technique that introduces semantics at the level of data curation.
- Semantic Interestingness Framework (SIF) for COVID-19 Data.
- Enhanced apriori approach with constraints (ConstApriori algorithm), which employs interestingness measures for semantic facts extracted from RDF data.
- Implementation of Clinical BERT and Bio BERT model for identifying the most interesting rules using a cosine similarity measure - Semantic Interestingness.
- Paper is under review in Connection Science Journal.
- Preprint available [here](../Connection_Science_2022.pdf).

## Affect Aware Tutoring System in E-Learning systems

- Developed a novel idea of ”Affect Aware Tutor System”.
- Paper documented and to be submitted in IEEE Transactions in Education Technology.
