### Problem Statement

You have to write a PRD for an Admin, who should be able to manage user access for a simple SaaS application. For example, an Admin managing access to Gmail for a company.

**Key Points**

- Cover both functional and non-functional specs.
- It's a fairly standard and fairly small feature, so make sure you cover it end to end.
- List any assumptions that you make.
- Your goal is to ensure that developers do not have to make any assumptions whatsoever anywhere, even the smallest.
- You don't need to do UI. Assume the UI design has already been completed.

### About Zenskar

- Let us assume we‚Äôre building a User Access Management feature for a SaaS application called [Zenskar](https://www.zenskar.com/). 
- Zenskar replaces the in-house billing engineering team of a SaaS company with its product. It is a billing software that handles complex SaaS pricing and usage data. This platform is used by companies that have variable pricing for their SaaS product.
- When a company uses Zenskar, the role of their: 
    - *Sales Team* is to build and modify sales contracts.
    - *Backend Team* is to integrate product APIs to Zenskar sharing usage data.
    - *Finance Team* is to draft invoices based on sales contracts and usage data.

- The platform has a set of predefined user roles, as mentioned above.

### Introduction to the PRD

In this PRD, we outlined the requirements to build a User Access Management (UAM) feature in Zenskar, a SaaS application designed for managing complex billing and usage data for companies with variable SaaS product pricing. 

The UAM, sometimes called as the Identity and Access Management (IAM) feature, enables admins to control user access, permissions, and roles within the application.

<div class="notion-divider"></div>

### Purpose of UAM / IAM

- To provide administrative control over user access within Zenskar.
- To support the creation, modification, and deletion of user accounts.
- To enhance data security and regulatory compliance for Zenskar's customers.

### Example Snapshot of some known platforms

> A. Google Workspace Admin Dashboard
> 
> ![Google Workspace](GoogleWorkspace.png)
> <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; font-size:15px;">Google Workspace Admin Dashboard, gives very simple User Access Management with Hierarchy : Admin > Normal User</p>
> 
> ![Add New Users](AddNewUsers.png)
> 
> <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; font-size:15px;">And giving options to Add New Users and Manage Permissions.</p>
> 

> B. File Sharing in Figma.
> 
> 
> ![Figma File Share](FigmaFileShare.png)
> 
> <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; font-size:15px;">Figma gives a better User Access Management feature in the form of file sharing. The admin can control and oversee other users‚Äô access to the file, managing permissions and roles. </p>
> <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; font-size:15px;">In Hierarchy : Owner > Can Edit > Can View > Can View Prototypes.</p>
> 

> C. File Sharing in Google Docs.
> 
> 
> ![Docs File Share](DocsFileShare.png)
> 
> <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; font-size:15px;">Similarly Google Docs, Sheets, etc. gives a file sharing feature. With 4 roles in Hierarchy: Owner > Editor > Commenter > Viewer. </p>
> <p style="text-align: left; margin-top: 5px; font-size:15px;">Also, the ownership could also be transferred and roles could be temporary with an expiry.</p>
