### Building Great Products by Connecting with Users

"Great products are built by talking to their users and customers." ðŸ’¡

A big thanks to the IIIT Dharwad students for inviting CometLabs.

Two years ago, we built the largest community of ~8000 techies, the IIITians Network, comprising students from IIITs, NITs, and IITs ðŸš€ðŸ”¥.

Our team is actively engaging with tech colleges, conducting sessions on #product building, #coding, #hiring in Tech #Startups, organizing #hackathons, #workshops, and demonstrating how #CometLabs fills these gaps.

I'm grateful to E-Cell, IIIT Dharwad, for the warm welcome, providing an opportunity to address the #founders of the future, listening to their #startup ideas, and mentoring them too.

I had the privilege of organizing a workshop at Deshpande Startups in collaboration with GDG Hubli for the Google I/O extended event. The focus of the workshop was to showcase and explain the importance of my EDA (Electronic Design Automation) project. This workshop held special significance for me as it marked the first time I conducted a session outside of my college. The experience was truly thrilling and invigorating. Presenting in front of a large audience of over 100 individuals was a remarkable experience that provided valuable insights and learning opportunities.

I had the opportunity to participate in a program organized at a local school near IIIT Dharwad, in collaboration with the IEEE Student Branch, IIIT Dharwad. During this program, I had the privilege of introducing the world of computers to students who had never encountered them before. It was a rewarding experience, and I felt a great sense of satisfaction in being able to contribute to my community in this way. I am truly proud of the work we accomplished together. I am eager to meet those students again in the future, as I would love to continue teaching them about various subjects and concepts that they may not have easy access to otherwise.
