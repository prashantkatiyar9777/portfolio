### Building Great Products by Connecting with Users

"Great products are built by talking to their users and customers." ðŸ’¡

A big thanks to the Indian Institute of Information Technology Dharwad students for inviting CometLabs.

Two years ago, we built the largest community of ~8000 techies, the IIITians Network, comprising students from IIITs, NITs, and IITs ðŸš€ðŸ”¥.

Our team is actively engaging with tech colleges, conducting sessions on #product building, #coding, #hiring in Tech #Startups, organizing #hackathons, #workshops, and demonstrating how #CometLabs fills these gaps.

I'm grateful to E-Cell, IIIT Dharwad, for the warm welcome, providing an opportunity to address the #founders of the future, listening to their #startup ideas, and mentoring them too.

ðŸ“Œ We'd love to meet you too, visit your campus, converse with developers, and connect them with tech startups. Let's connect.

I delivered a presentation on the topic of OpenSource, sharing insights on how to excel in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program and compose a compelling application. Additionally, I discussed my personal experience of participating in GSoC at PEcAn within my university. The students showed immense enthusiasm upon learning about the project and the vibrant community surrounding it. The talk garnered a significant turnout, with over 100 attendees, providing them with valuable knowledge and an enriching learning experience. The accompanying pictures showcase some noteworthy moments from the talk.

## Importance of EDA - Google I/O 2022

I had the privilege of organizing a workshop at Deshpande Startups in collaboration with GDG Hubli for the Google I/O extended event. The focus of the workshop was to showcase and explain the importance of my EDA (Electronic Design Automation) project. This workshop held special significance for me as it marked the first time I conducted a session outside of my college. The experience was truly thrilling and invigorating. Presenting in front of a large audience of over 100 individuals was a remarkable experience that provided valuable insights and learning opportunities.

## Empowering the Community: Introducing Computers to New Learners

I had the opportunity to participate in a program organized at a local school near IIIT Dharwad, in collaboration with the IEEE Student Branch, IIIT Dharwad. During this program, I had the privilege of introducing the world of computers to students who had never encountered them before. It was a rewarding experience, and I felt a great sense of satisfaction in being able to contribute to my community in this way. I am truly proud of the work we accomplished together. I am eager to meet those students again in the future, as I would love to continue teaching them about various subjects and concepts that they may not have easy access to otherwise.
