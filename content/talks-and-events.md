As a postman student leader, I had the privilege of conducting a two-day workshop on APIs for the students of IIT Dharwad. The workshop was organized by the Techniosys Club of IIIT Dharwad and witnessed an impressive attendance of over 100 students. On Day 1, Mr. Pratik Pakhale, the then Postman Student expert, and I delivered a comprehensive talk on API 101, providing valuable insights and knowledge. Day 2 featured an exciting Postman API certification competition, where students competed to complete the certification in the fastest time possible, with prizes awaiting the winners. The workshop was a tremendous success, fostering learning and engagement among the students.

The talk garnered a significant turnout, with over 100 attendees, providing them with valuable knowledge and an enriching learning experience.

I had the privilege of organizing a workshop at Deshpande Startups in collaboration with GDG Hubli for the Google I/O extended event. The focus of the workshop was to showcase and explain the importance of my EDA (Electronic Design Automation) project. This workshop held special significance for me as it marked the first time I conducted a session outside of my college. The experience was truly thrilling and invigorating. Presenting in front of a large audience of over 100 individuals was a remarkable experience that provided valuable insights and learning opportunities.

I had the opportunity to participate in a program organized at a local school near IIIT Dharwad, in collaboration with the IEEE Student Branch, IIIT Dharwad. During this program, I had the privilege of introducing the world of computers to students who had never encountered them before. It was a rewarding experience, and I felt a great sense of satisfaction in being able to contribute to my community in this way. I am truly proud of the work we accomplished together. I am eager to meet those students again in the future, as I would love to continue teaching them about various subjects and concepts that they may not have easy access to otherwise.
