## Project Summary

## My Proposal

This project is primarily focused on creating an interactive display of the carbon cycle forecast and data assimilation system of PEcAn. The main goal is to revive the site-specific R Shiny Forecasting and SDA dashboard that is no longer operational and broaden its scope to cover a larger number of sites. Additionally, the plan is to construct a new comprehensive dashboard that combines both SDA and Forecasting graphs. Moreover, the proposal also aims to establish an automated notification email system for the visualizations.
