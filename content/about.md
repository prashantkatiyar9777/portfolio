## Beyond the Desk

### Travel and Exploration

Away from tech, I recharge through travelâ€”either alone or with loved ones. These journeys are more than escapes; they've been the catalyst for my startup. Each trip offers cultural insights and valuable learnings. In downtime, I delve into books and case studies focused on emerging business and finance trends.


### Musical Escapes

Music is my refuge. Especially, the pulsating rhythms of EDM resonate with me. It's a fervent wish of mine to be swept up in the magic of an [Alan Walker](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7vk5e3vY1uw9plTHJAMwjN?si=wZ2-yAcXQWaRhzsjbrFzdw) EDM night.

Open to connect to discuss tech, travel, or even the latest EDM tracks.
